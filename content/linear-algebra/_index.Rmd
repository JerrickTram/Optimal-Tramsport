\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

This array has 1 row and 4 columns making it a 1D array or a 1 x 4 **vector.**

\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  4 & 5 & 6
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

This array has 2 rows and 3 columns making it a 2D array or a 2 x 3 **matrix.**

Linear algebra is essential to many optimization techniques in addition to 
statistics (especially forecasting). In many, if not all industries, data will be 
formatted in vectors and/or matrices. Even a set of inputs can be paired with outputs
as vectors and/or matrices. For those who worked with spreadsheets before, 
you already have exposure to vectors and matrices in the form of tables. Typically, 
the numbers in those tables will involve constraints, KPIs, metrics of a variable 
(coefficients), etc. This is designed to be a **short introduction** to linear 
algebra towards developing working knowledge. These topics include:

* [Systems of Linear Equations](./1)
* [Linear Independence and Dependence](./2)
* [Determinants](./3)
* [Orthogonality](./4)
* [Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](./5)

In linear algebra, standard notation for representing rows and columns in a vector
or matrix is m x n respectively.
