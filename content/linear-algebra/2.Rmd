If you've ever heard of redundancy, you're probably heard about it in two 
different lights:

* In a [just in case (JIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) 
situation, that inventory management strategy focuses on keeping some products
at hand to avoid shortages. With the abundance of shortages nowadays with COVID
playing a role in port backlogs, this strategy might be preferable at this time.
* In a [just in time (JIT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp) situation, 
that inventory management strategy prioritizes removing unnecessary waste and 
increasing efficiency.

In the case of linear independence, we're referring to the 2nd option. There are 
many potential solutions to solve any given problem. In linear algebra, there
are also infinitely **linear combinations** of
