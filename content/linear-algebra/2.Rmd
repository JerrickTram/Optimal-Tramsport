If you've ever heard of redundancy, you're probably heard about it in two 
different lights:

* In a [just in case (JIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) 
situation, that inventory management strategy focuses on keeping some products
at hand to avoid shortages. With the abundance of shortages nowadays with COVID
playing a role in port backlogs, this strategy might be preferable at this time.
* In a [just in time (JIT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp) situation, 
that inventory management strategy prioritizes removing unnecessary waste and 
increasing efficiency.

In the case of linear independence, we're referring to the 2nd option. We want to
understand all vectors from a set in all real numbers such that the vector 
equation has a possible solution. In most cases, that solution would normally be
the key to solving a system of linear equations.

\begin{align}
\text{Span}\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \} = \{a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_ix_i | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \in \mathbb{R}\}
\end{align}
