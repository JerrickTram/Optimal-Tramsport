<p>If you’ve ever heard of redundancy, you’re probably heard about it in two
different lights:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp">just in case (JIC)</a>
situation, that inventory management strategy focuses on keeping some products
at hand to avoid shortages. With the abundance of shortages nowadays with COVID
playing a role in port backlogs, this strategy might be preferable at this time.</li>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp">just in time (JIT)</a> situation,
that inventory management strategy prioritizes removing unnecessary waste and
increasing efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of linear independence, we’re referring to the 2nd option. We want to
understand all vectors from a set in all real numbers such that the vector
equation has a possible solution. In most cases, that solution would normally be
the key to solving a system of linear equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{Span}\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \} = \{a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_ix_i | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \in \mathbb{R}\}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
