<p>If you’ve ever heard of redundancy, you’re probably heard about it in two
different lights:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp">just in case (JIC)</a>
situation, that inventory management strategy focuses on keeping some products
at hand to avoid shortages. With the abundance of shortages nowadays with COVID
playing a role in port backlogs, this strategy might be preferable at this time.</li>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp">just in time (JIT)</a> situation,
that inventory management strategy prioritizes removing unnecessary waste and
increasing efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of linear independence, we’re referring to the 2nd option. There are
many potential solutions to solve any given problem. Just like how some problems
can have cut those options down to an optimal solution, you can cut down on
constraints <strong>if they can be removed without affecting the system.</strong></p>
