<h2>Logistics Center Scheduling</h2>
<p>When it comes to scheduling work shifts, the staff consists of employees. Typically,
someone who works full-time will work 5 days a week. In addition, we also need to
have a minimum amount of people to work a specific day of the week if the work
site is a 24/7 operation (i.e. manufacturing plants). In this example, we’re
scheduling employees in a logistics center with certain requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each employee works 5 consecutive days before taking 2 consecutive days of
rest</li>
<li>There’s 7 shifts: Monday to Friday, Tuesday to Saturday, etc.</li>
<li>We want to <strong>minimize</strong> the number of employees hired.</li>
<li>The number of warehouse workers required for each day:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>## The number of warehouse workers needed on Monday is 99.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Tuesday is 78.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Wednesday is 57.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Thursday is 50.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Friday is 55.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Saturday is 87.
## The number of warehouse workers needed on Sunday is 52.</code></pre>
<p>While you can assign 99 warehouse workers to start on Monday and 87 warehouse
workers to start on Saturday, odds are that solution isn’t the best choice for
our objective. Reason for that, you’ll have too slack/idle workers on days that
overlap during those shifts (i.e. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).</p>

  Min ~ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 ~ s.t. \\
    x_1 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 &amp; \geq b_1 \\
    x_1 + x_2 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 &amp; \geq b_2 \\
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_6 + x_7 &amp; \geq b_3 \\
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_7 &amp; \geq b_4 \\
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 &amp; \geq b_5 \\
    x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 &amp; \geq b_6 \\
    x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 &amp; \geq b_7 \\
    x_i \geq 0, \forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., 7\}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Most scheduling problems will have more decision variables/constraints than this
for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some employees are part-time</li>
<li>Some employees may work multiple shifts (i.e. overtime)</li>
<li>There’s regulations on how many consecutive shifts with overtime someone can do</li>
<li>A percentage of workers in a certain shift cannot exceed some set limit</li>
<li>A percentage of part-time workers cannot exceed a certain percentage</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, the way to find the optimal solution mathematically is through
elimination and/or substitution. In order to formulate larger scale scheduling
problems, compact formulations are used for readability purposes and reducing
redundancy.</p>
