# Background Information

For those who aren't familiar with operations research (OR), OR is the mathematical
modeling used to find the best solution out of many to support better decision
making. The prominence of OR back to its military origins 
during WWI and WWII. Scientists worked with the British Royal Navy, the 
British Royal Air Force (RAF), the British Admiralty, and the US Armed Forces to 
accomplish notable feats such as:

* Reducing casualty rates of merchant ships from 10% to 0.5% by deploying the 
convoy system and hunting German U-Boats.
* Improved air defense capabilities 20-fold with the implementation of radar 
to detect German aircraft.
* Establishment of US Military and civilian OR groups.
* The introduction of the simplex method and linear programming by George B. Dantzig.
* The creation of the MIT OR Center under Philip M. Morse.

Today, OR categorized under several different names in the form of prescriptive
analytics, management science, decision science, data science, mathematical
optimization, and more. While there's many interesting aspects of OR, this book is 
about applying OR methodology to transporting goods from one place to another
in a cost-efficient and timely manner. Whether it'd be by port, truck, or rail, 
freight transport and logistics play a major role in the success of any economy.

## Why I've Created this Website

Honestly, a bit of luck and timing played a role. With the abundant news of
supply chain issues[^1] (such as port backlogs and inventory shortages) rooting 
from a myriad of sources, it'd benefit many professionals who want to learn about 
the quantitative aspects of transporting and delivering goods. Also, it wouldn't 
hurt to add some elements of risk management as no strategy is 100% guaranteed. 
While it's ideal to minimize risk, the path to success in life requires taking 
on some level of risk to achieve the objectives you're aiming for. If you're an 
experienced practitioner looking for new techniques and methods, this isn't the 
site to find them. The content in this site isn't too different from classic OR 
texts like @winston_2004. In addition, this site isn't a guide on how to use 
Python[^2] or Gurobi[^3] as its assumed that you have some familiarity with those 
tools. 

[^1]: @chapman_tony_gatewood_clive_2016 for an overview of the supply chain industry.

[^2]: @halvorsen_2020 would be the best book to pick up Python for mathematical applications.

[^3]: Gurobi has a [quick start guide](Gurobi Optimizer Quick Start Guide V9.0.pdf).

## Target Audience

The assumption is that the reader is familiar with calculus[^4], linear algebra[^5], and
statistics[^6]. Nonetheless, anyone who stumbled upon this site through a search engine 
will be able to pick the content up. This isn't merely about getting a job done 
but more so of having the "what else can I do with this" mindset. That's how 
innovation comes to fruition; applying the same tools to different things and 
experimenting. For instance, there's plenty of research done on airline routing 
but what about ships or drones? The goal at hand is so that a high school graduate 
at minimum could unleash their creativity with operations research at their disposal.
