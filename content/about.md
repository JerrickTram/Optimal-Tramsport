title: About Operations Research Applications in Freight Transport and Logistics
---

For those who aren't too familiar operations research (OR), OR involves applying
quantitative methodology whether it'd be statistics or optimization to support
better decision making. This site serves as a project that will receive updates
for operations research applications in the transportation, logistics, and 
freight rail industry. Keep in mind this is about the industry and the 
applications won't be purely examples of getting from point A to point B. Some
aspects such as freight rate pricing and inventory management will be included as well.
