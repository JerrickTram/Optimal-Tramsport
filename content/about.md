For those who aren't too familiar with industrial engineering and/or operations
research. Industrial engineering is focused on improving the effectiveness,
efficiency, and safety of organizational processes and systems through 
technical methodology. While operations research also involves optimization,
the quantitative methodology is applied to supporting better decision-making. 
Because both fields complement each other quite well, the theoretical and 
practical knowledge are applicable to just about everything.
