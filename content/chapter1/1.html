<h2>Designing a System of Linear Equations</h2>
<p>How exactly is linear algebra a key component in many optimization and
statistics problems? The answer is solving the title of this section.
In most optimization problems, we want to find the <strong>best</strong> way to allocate
resources to accomplish a goal. Not the largest/smallest nor longest/shortest
way, but <strong>optimal.</strong> Deriving from an example in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Yoshida2021" role="doc-biblioref">Yoshida 2021</a>)</span>, a freight rail
company wants to transport commodities <span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\)</span> from one place to
another. However, they can’t transport the entire inventory of each commodity at
once due to constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>An order of commodities <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> weigh 1, 2, and 3 tons respectively
as the weight capacity is 1,250 tons.</li>
<li>Commodities <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> require 2, 1, and 4 freight cars each with
1,800 freight cars available.</li>
<li>Commodities <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> must total 300 units.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1250 \\
    2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1800 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 300
  \end{array}\right] \leftrightarrow
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    x_1 &amp; 2x_3 &amp; 3x_3 &amp; 1250 \\
    2x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; 4x_3 &amp; 1800 \\
    &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3 &amp; 300
  \end{array}\right]
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the left-hand side (LHS), you have your coefficient matrix which is made up
of the unit values from your commodities. <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3\)</span> are referred to as
<strong>decision variables</strong> since we’re trying to figure out the quantity needed to
fulfill our linear equations. On the right-hand side (RHS), we have our
<strong>constraints</strong> which are our limitations/restrictions.</p>

<h2>Solving a System of Linear Equations</h2>
<p>Normally, this problem set would be solved through <a href="https://www.math.usm.edu/lambers/mat610/sum10/lecture4.pdf">gaussian elimination and back
substitution</a>.
Basically, you’re eliminating unknown variables by manipulating equations with
elementary row reductions. For example, if I wanted to get rid of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> in the
2nd equation, replace the 2nd equation by the sum of multiplying the 1st equation
by -2 and the 2nd equation itself. You do this repeatedly until an equation has a
single unknown.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    -2 &amp; -4 &amp; -6 &amp; -2500 \\
    2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1800 \\ \hline
    0 &amp; -3 &amp; -2 &amp; -700 
  \end{array}\right] \rightarrow
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 150 \\
    0 &amp; -3 &amp; -2 &amp; -700 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 300
  \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 150 \\
    0 &amp; -3 &amp; -2 &amp; -700 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 900
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> results in 300 when dividing the constraint by the coefficient of commodity
<span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span>. For the back substitution, plug in 300 into <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> in equation 2 to solve for
<span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> resulting in 100. Plug both values into their respective values in equation 1
to get 450 for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. As a result, <span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3) = (450, 100, 200)\)</span>. As our
systems of linear equations begin to scale in size, it isn’t practical to solve
them by hand. Instead, we will use Python’s scientific computing capabilities.</p>
