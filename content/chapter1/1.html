<h2>Vectors and Matrices</h2>
<div id="matrix-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Matrix 1</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np

M = np.array([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [5, 4, 6],
  [7, 9, 8]
])


print(M)</code></pre>

<p>Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays with only 1 row and/or 1 column. For instance,
a 1 x 4 array would have 1 row and 4 columns. A 4 x 1 array would have 4 rows and
1 column. Typically, <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> is the standard notation to represent arrays/matrices.
You can probably make an educated guess that matrices aren’t restricted to only
1 unit/variable per dimension. In the case of <a href="#matrix-1">Matrix 1</a>, we have a <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span>
matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns which is a 2-dimensional array.</p>

<h3>Matrix 2</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  M = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \dots &amp; a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \dots &amp; a_{2n} \\

<p>The numbers in the <em>i</em>th row and <em>j</em>th column of matrix <em>M</em> are known as the
<strong><em>ij</em></strong>th element of M notated as <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-winston_2004" role="doc-biblioref">Winston 2004</a>)</span>. Referring back to <a href="#matrix-1">Matrix 1</a>,
<span class="math inline">\(a_{21}\)</span> would be 2, <span class="math inline">\(a_{33}\)</span> would be 8, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="python"><code># The value at a12 of matrix 1
print(M[0][1])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 2</code></pre>
<p>The above statement was run in <code>Python</code> to find the <span class="math inline">\(a_{12}\)</span>th element of <a href="#matrix-1">Matrix 1</a>.
Note that Python uses 0-based numbering so when referring to the entire 1st row
of a matrix, <strong>you would start at 0 instead of 1</strong> i.e. <code>matrixname[0]</code>.</p>

<div id="matrix-arithmetic" class="section level2">
<h2>Matrix Arithmetic</h2>
<p>If you recall the PEMDAS mnemonic device from K-12, the same logic applies when
using matrix operations. Any matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and number <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (sometimes called scalars),
the matrix <span class="math inline">\(cA\)</span> exists by multiplying <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by each element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In other words,
the distribution property at play. No different from multiplying a matrix by
another matrix although they apply to corresponding elements i.e. <span class="math inline">\(a_{11} \times b_{11}\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>3*M</code></pre>
<pre><code>## array([[ 3,  6,  9],
##        [15, 12, 18],
##        [21, 27, 24]])</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Another way to represent the result above is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3
\end{bmatrix}
\times 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
5 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\
7 &amp; 9 &amp; 8
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<p>This example is derived from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span>. You’re an industrial
engineer in charge of improving operations for an aerospace firm. However,
you also need to know what productivity measures/results to look for before
starting to look into processes. After all, the main goal of any for-profit
organization is to produce high-quality products at reasonable prices and
delivery times. Because COVID has disrupted supply chains worldwide, you’re
prioritizing ways to improve cycle times. The 1st matrix involves
the production time (days) of product <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> while the 2nd matrix
involves the total orders of product <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> (per 1000 orders). We want to
find the cycle times through <strong>dividing production time by order volume</strong> of product <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>## [[57 93 48]
##  [63 86 34]
##  [25 59 33]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[7 9 1]
##  [6 1 7]
##  [3 1 6]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[ 8.14285714 10.33333333 48.        ]
##  [10.5        86.          4.85714286]
##  [ 8.33333333 59.          5.5       ]]</code></pre>
<p>Its best to talk with the production team for their assessment of the production
time of product <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span>. That way, you have a better way to measure cycle time
vs throwing a random figure out there. Depending on the product, the cycle times
of products <span class="math inline">\(a_{13}, a_{23}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{32}\)</span> <strong>might</strong> (I’m emphasizing this for
reason) be an issue. The time it takes to manufacture microchips vs the F-35
Lighting II (combat aircraft) differ massively. There are other productivity
measurements such as labor costs, dollars per square foot, etc. from
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span> if you have further interest in productivity metrics.</p>
