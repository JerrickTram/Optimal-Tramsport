## Designing a System of Linear Equations

How exactly is linear algebra a key component in many optimization and 
statistics problems? The answer is solving the title of this section. 
In most optimization problems, we want to find the **best** way to allocate
resources to accomplish a goal. Not the largest/smallest nor longest/shortest
way, but **optimal.** Deriving from an example in [@Yoshida2021], a freight rail
company wants to transport commodities $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ from one place to 
another. However, they can't transport the entire inventory of each commodity at 
once due to constraints:

* Commodities $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ weigh 1, 2, and 3 tons respectively as the 
weight capacity is 1,250 tons. 
* Commodities $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ require 2, 1, and 4 freight cars each with
1,800 freight cars available.
* Commodities $x_2$ and $x_3$ must total 300 units.

\begin{align}
  
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 1250 \\
    2 & 1 & 4 & 1800 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 300
  \end{array}\right] \leftrightarrow
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    x_1 & 2x_3 & 3x_3 & 1250 \\
    2x_1 & x_2 & 4x_3 & 1800 \\
    & x_2 & x_3 & 300
  \end{array}\right]
\end{align}

> On the left-hand side (LHS), you have your coefficient matrix which are made up
of the unit values from your commodities. $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are referred to as 
**decision variables** since we're trying to figure out the quantity needed to 
fulfill our linear equations. On the right-hand side (RHS), we have our 
**constraints** which are our limitations or restrictions.

## Solving a System of Linear Equations

Normally, this problem set would be solved through [gaussian elimination and back 
substitution](https://www.math.usm.edu/lambers/mat610/sum10/lecture4.pdf). 
Basically, you're eliminating unknown variables by manipulating equations with
elementary row reductions. For example, if I wanted to get rid of $x_1$ in the 
2nd equation, replace the 2nd equation by the sum of multiplying the 1st equation 
by -2 and the 2nd equation itself. You do this repeatedly until an equation has a 
single unknown. 

\begin{align}
  \left[\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
    -2 & -4 & -6 & -2500 \\
    2 & 1 & 4 & 1800 \\ \hline
    0 & -3 & -2 & -700 
  \end{array}\right] \rightarrow
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 150 \\
    0 & -3 & -2 & -700 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 300
  \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 150 \\
    0 & -3 & -2 & -700 \\
    0 & 0 & 3 & 900
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

$x_3$ results in 300 when dividing the constraint by the coefficient of commodity
$x_3$. For the back substitution, plug in 300 into $x_3$ in equation 2 to solve for 
$x_2$ resulting in 100. Plug both values into their respective values in equation 1
to get 450 for $x_1$. As a result, $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (450, 100, 200)$. As our 
systems of linear equations begin to scale in size, it isn't practical to solve 
them by hand. Instead, we will use Python's scientific computing capabilities. 

```{python}
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [2, 1, 4],
              [0, 1, 1]])
b = np.array([1250, 1800, 300])

def eroLEQ(matrix, constraints):
  A = matrix
  b = constraints
  
  if A.shape[0] == A.shape[1]:
    # Note: linalg.solve only accepts square matrices in the 1st parameter
    return np.linalg.solve(A, b)
  else:
    # lstsq for rectangular matrices
    return np.linalg.lstsq(A, b, rcond = None)[0]

eroLEQ(A, b)
```

## Working Examples
### Traffic Flow

Even freight trains aren't immune to waiting for traffic despite being rail-bound. 
From [@corman_trivella_keyvan-ekbatani_2021], this paper goes into modeling train
behavior in a way similar to driving cars. If you're in charge of designing 
railways, knowing how to build railroad networks around the volume of trains is 
certainly a priority. In the image below, we have a network (admittedly poorly 
designed) where we have north-south and west-east traffic.
