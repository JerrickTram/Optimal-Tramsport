## Designing a System of Linear Equations

How exactly is linear algebra a key component in many optimization and 
statistics problems? The answer is solving the title of this section. 
In most optimization problems, we want to find the **best** way to allocate
resources to accomplish a goal. Not the largest/smallest nor longest/shortest
way, but **optimal.** Deriving from an example in [@Yoshida2021], an industrial 
gas company wants to transport gas canisters from their production sites (A, B) 
to their distributors (C, D). Distributor C have a demand of 500 canisters/week 
and 400 canisters/week for Distributor D. In addition, production sites A and B
can supply 600 and 500 canisters/week respectively. Formulating the system of 
linear equations:

\begin{align}
x_{AC} + x_{AD} = 600 \\
x_{BC} + x_{BD} = 500 \\
x_{AC} + x_{BC} = 500 \\
x_{AD} + x_{BD} = 400
\end{align}
