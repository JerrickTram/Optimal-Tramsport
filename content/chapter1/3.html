<p>If you’ve ever heard of redundancy, you’re probably heard about it in two
different lights:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp">just in case (JIC)</a> situation. For those in the supply chain industry,
that inventory management strategy might be preferred after what’s going on
with these port backlogs.</li>
<li>Removing unnecessary waste</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of linear independence, we’re referring to the 2nd option.
Vector spaces can have many vectors (with the exception of zero vectors)
although we’re only interested in a specific one. In most cases, that would be
the solution to a system of linear equations.</p>
