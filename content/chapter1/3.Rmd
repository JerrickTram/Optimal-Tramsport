If you've ever heard of redundancy, you're probably heard about it in two 
different lights:

* In a [just in case (JIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) situation. For those in the supply chain industry, 
that inventory management strategy might be preferred after what's going on 
with these port backlogs.
* Removing unnecessary waste

In the case of linear independence, we're referring to the 2nd option. 
Vector spaces can have many vectors (with the exception of zero vectors) 
although we're only interested in a specific one. In most cases, that would be 
the solution to a system of linear equations.
