If you've ever heard of redundancy, you're probably heard about it in two 
different lights:

* In a [just in case (JIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jic.asp) 
situation. For those in the supply chain industry, that inventory management 
strategy might be preferred after what's going on with these port backlogs.
* Removing unnecessary waste 

In the case of linear independence, we're referring to the 2nd option. We want to
understand all vectors from a set in all real numbers such that the vector 
equation has a possible solution. In most cases, that solution would normally be
the key to solving a system of linear equations. 

\begin{align}
\text{Span}\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \} = \{a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_ix_i | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \in \bb_{R}\}
\end{align}
