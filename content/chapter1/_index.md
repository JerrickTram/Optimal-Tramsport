title: Linear Algebra 
weight: 10
---

This section will be referring to the linear algebra section from a classic
operations research textbook [^1]. Linear algebra is essential to many 
optimization techniques in addition to statistics in general (especially 
predictive modeling). In many (if not all industries), data will be formatted in 
vectors and/or matrices. For those who have worked with spreadsheets before, you 
already have seen them in those forms as tables. Typically, the numbers in those 
tables will involve total constraints,metrics of a variable (coefficients), etc. 
This is designed to be a **basic introduction** to linear algebra towards 
developing working knowledge. These topics include:

* [Vectors Spaces](./1)
* [Systems of Linear Equations](./2)
* [Gaussian Elimination](./3)
* [Linear Transformations](./4)
* [Diagonalization, Eigenvalues, and Eigenvectors](./5)
