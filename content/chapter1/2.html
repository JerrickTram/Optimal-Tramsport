<h2>Designing a System of Linear Equations</h2>
<p>How exactly is linear algebra a key component in many optimization and
statistics problems? The answer is solving the title of this section.
In most optimization problems, we want to find the <strong>best</strong> way to allocate
resources to accomplish a goal. Not the largest/smallest nor longest/shortest
way, but <strong>optimal.</strong> Deriving from an example in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Yoshida2021" role="doc-biblioref">Yoshida 2021</a>)</span>, an industrial
gas company wants to transport gas canisters from their production sites (A, B)
to their distributors (C, D). Distributor C have a demand of 500 canisters/week
and 400 canisters/week for Distributor D. In addition, production sites A and B
can supply 600 and 500 canisters/week respectively. Formulating the system of
linear equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
x_{AC} + x_{AD} = 600 \\
x_{BC} + x_{BD} = 500 \\
x_{AC} + x_{BC} = 500 \\
x_{AD} + x_{BD} = 400
\end{align}\]</span></p>
