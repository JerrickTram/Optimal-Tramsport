<h2>Functions of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Professionals</h2>
<p>As the 70s and 80s approached, some talks claimed that industrial engineering was
losing its identity with more quantitative techniques and computers being
introduced. Yet the differences between industrial engineering and operations
research couldn’t get any more distinct <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-holsten_1999" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>holsten_1999?</strong></a>)</span>. If we were to look at
the BLS and compare occupations:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Industrial Engineers</strong></p>
<p>“Industrial engineers devise efficient systems that integrate workers, machines,
materials, information, and energy to make a product or provide a service.”</p>
<p><strong>Operations Research Analyst</strong></p>
<p>“Operations research analysts use advanced mathematical and analytical methods
to help solve complex issues.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Industrial engineering specializes in manufacturing and production in particular
for process improvement <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span>. Methodology includes lean
manufacturing, six sigma, and just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing. The latter may
eventually be phased out due to COVID causing supply shocks especially in ports.
Operations research focuses on <strong>how to optimize</strong> resources at hand to achieve
an organizational goal. While operations research analysts are involved in some
of those processes, they are not directly involved despite helping in that
decision-making process.</p>
