<h2>Functions of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Professionals</h2>
<p>As the 70s and 80s approached, some talks claimed that industrial engineering was
losing its identity with more quantitative techniques and computers being
introduced. Yet the differences between industrial engineering and operations
research couldn’t get any more distinct <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-holsten_1999" role="doc-biblioref">Holsten 1999</a>)</span>. If we were to look at
the BLS and compare occupations:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Industrial Engineers</strong></p>
<p>“Industrial engineers devise efficient systems that integrate workers, machines,
materials, information, and energy to make a product or provide a service.”</p>
<p><strong>Operations Research Analyst</strong></p>
<p>“Operations research analysts use advanced mathematical and analytical methods
to help solve complex issues.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Industrial engineering is more domain-focused (manufacturing in particular) on
<strong>optimizing processes.</strong> Operations research focuses on <strong>how to optimize</strong>
resources at hand to achieve an organizational goal. You’ll see the skillsets of
industrial engineers involve quality control, improving production flow, and
time/cost reduction. While operations research analysts are involved in some of
those processes, they are not normally the main decision makers despite helping
in the decision-making process.</p>
