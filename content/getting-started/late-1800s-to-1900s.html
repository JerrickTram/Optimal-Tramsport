<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Reliability. That’s a word we take for granted these days as we rely more on
tools and infrastructure. Century-old infrastructure projects including the
pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and Roman coliseums were hallmarks for
engineering accomplishments. While these feats are significant, <strong>they aren’t
immune to the forces of mother nature and father time.</strong> Thus, the need for
maintenance and upkeep still exists <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nachlas_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Nachlas 2017</a>)</span>. Nearly everyone at some
point in their lives, will experience some sort of failure both internally and
externally. That’s why those experiences are used to improve among ourselves to
create stronger products, make better decisions, and obtain longer product life
cycles <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span>. That is what ties industrial engineering,
operations research, and reliability engineering together.</p>
