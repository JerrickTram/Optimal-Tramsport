<h2>Operations Research in WWI</h2>
<p>Aside from technological inventions, industrial engineering didn’t stand out as
much as operations research did. During WWI, German U-Boats were an issue for
the British as they sunk convoy ships to disrupt supply lines. British
scientists came together to find the best way to model their convoy fleets
based on ship size, speed, and deployment timing. The US didn’t get involved
in WWI until roughly 2 years after the RMS Lusitania sinking incident. As a
result, US ships escorted those convoys while participating in submarine hunting.
The combined forces of optimized British convoys and US naval ships allowed
British convoy fatality rates to drop from 10% to 0.5% <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-theorsocietyuk_2017" role="doc-biblioref">TheORSocietyUK 2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2>Operations Research in WWII</h2>
<p>After WWI, operations research gained more prominence through the development
of radar. A.P. Rowe’s and Robert Watson-Watt’s breakthrough alongside the
assistance of Royal Air Force officers improved the UK’s air defense
capabilities by 20-fold <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-theorsocietyuk_2017" role="doc-biblioref">TheORSocietyUK 2017</a>)</span>. Patrick Blackett, a British
physicist, redeployed the convoy system from WWI and tested the UK’s new radar
capabilities with great success. The U.S. Air Force eventually decided to have
their own operations research groups for wargaming purposes. After WWII,
mathematician George B. Dantzig developed the linear programming formulation
(Leonid Vitalievich Kantorovich from the USSR although came up with it although
his work wasn’t popular among USSR economists) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-matlab_2020" role="doc-biblioref">MATLAB 2020</a>)</span>. Operations
research become widespread in the US private sector where over half of US
companies used it at some function <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-holsten_1998" role="doc-biblioref">Holsten 1998</a>)</span>.</p>
