<p>During WWI, German U-Boats were an issue for the British as they sunk convoy ships
to disrupt supply lines <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-history_editors_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Editors 2009</a>)</span>. Unrestricted submarine warfare
took its toll sinking thousands of British vessels. The British Royal Navy have
considered implementing the convoy system into action but hesitated due to the potential
costs as 1) ships have to travel slowly to maintain the convoy alignment and
2) battleships. However, British scientists came together to find the best way to
model their convoy fleets based on ship size, speed, and deployment timing. In addition,
the US got involved in WWI roughly 2 years after the RMS Lusitania sinking incident
from German U-Boats. As a result, the US provided destroyers to escort those convoys while
participating in submarine hunting. The combined forces of optimized British
convoys and US naval ships allowed British convoy fatality rates to drop from 10%
to 0.5%.</p>

<p>After WWI, operations research gained more prominence through the development
of radar. Originally, the British were looking to construct a death ray to counteract
German aircraft (which was deemed impossible). However, when they discovered that
those same aircraft was disturbing communication waves, a hypothesis developed of
radio waves potentially detecting aircraft. A.P. Rowe’s and Robert Watson-Watt’s
breakthrough alongside the assistance of Royal Air Force officers improved the
UK’s air defense capabilities by 20-fold. Patrick Blackett, a British physicist,
redeployed the convoy system from WWI and tested the UK’s new radar capabilities
with great success. The U.S. Air Force eventually decided to have their own
operations research groups for wargaming purposes. After WWII, mathematician George
B. Dantzig developed the linear programming formulation for the Air Force to
optimize planning costs (Leonid Vitalievich Kantorovich from the USSR had the
concept earlier although his work wasn’t popular among USSR economists).</p>

<h2>Operations Research Post WWII to Today</h2>
<p>Operations research has become widespread in the US private sector where over
half of US companies have applied it to some capacity. Using mathematical models
to find the best solution out of many is a useful skill in any industry. The
branding has changed over the years with alias such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision science</li>
<li>Management science</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, the applications that exist today are endless thanks to the
advancements in computing power and technology in general.</p>
