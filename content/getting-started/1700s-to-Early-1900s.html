<div id="origins" class="section level2">
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Reliability. That’s a word we take for granted these days as we rely more on
tools and infrastructure. Century-old infrastructure projects including the
pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and Roman coliseums were hallmarks for
engineering accomplishments. While these feats are significant, <strong>they aren’t
immune to the forces of mother nature and father time.</strong> Thus, the need for
maintenance and upkeep still exists <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nachlas_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Nachlas 2017</a>)</span>. Nearly everyone at some
point in their lives, will experience some sort of failure both internally and
externally. That’s why those experiences are used to improve among ourselves to
create stronger products, make better decisions, and obtain longer product life
cycles <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span>. That is what ties industrial engineering,
operations research, and reliability engineering together.</p>

<div id="industrial-revolution-and-onwards" class="section level2">
<h2>Industrial Revolution and Onwards</h2>
<p>While there isn’t an exact date as of when industrial engineering started,
most historians look at the Industrial Revolution due to how
manufacturing practices changed and the technological innovations that
developed during that timeline. Notable inventions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flying shuttle (Kay 1733)</li>
<li>Spinning jenny (Hargreaves 1765)</li>
<li>Steam engine (Watt 1765)</li>
<li>Water frame (Arkwright 1769)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, one could guess which one of these inventions
paved the way for power generation. The steam engine allowed manufacturers to
look at other sources of power instead of relying solely on hydroelectric w
power. As a result, production costs fell, prices fell, and areas that normally
wouldn’t have access to hydroelectric energy now have an accessible power
source through steam. These innovations gave birth to the idea of a production
system due to the increased accessibility.</p>

<div id="interchangeability-and-scientific-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Interchangeability and Scientific Management</h2>
<p>Before people could buy individual parts for machinery, everything was put
together under one person. Thanks to the efforts of Eli Whitney and Simeon
North, individual parts could be mass-produced to specifications for any
finished product <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maynard_zandin_2001" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard and Zandin 2001</a>)</span>. If interchangeability didn’t exist,
you’d have to go to same craftsman for fixes who may or may not be readily
available. Frederick W. Taylor on the other hand, wanted to find out “the best
way to do a job” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gass_assad_2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gass and Assad 2005</a>)</span>. Under his system, he focused on removing
wasteful movements of each component within the production process. As a result,
work efficiency improved tremendously, time spent on tasks were reduced, and
work measurement standards were developed. In a way, Taylor accomplished the
same goal with work as Whitney did with parts.</p>

<div id="project-planning" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Planning</h2>
<p>For those who have worked on any project(s) in any environment, you probably
have seen bar charts that displays the project schedule. Gannt charts, invented
by Henry L. Grantt, proposed them to be used to represent the precedence
relationship between tasks, completion schedules, and tracking performance.
Its commonly used with in the construction industry with the numerous steps
necessary before moving on to the next phases of construction (i.e. need walls
and a floor before you can build a roof).</p>
