## Functions of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Professionals

As the 70s and 80s approached, some talks claimed that industrial engineering was
losing its identity with more quantitative techniques and computers being 
introduced. Yet the differences between industrial engineering and operations 
research couldn't get any more distinct [@holsten_1999]. If we were to look at 
the BLS and compare occupations:

---

**Industrial Engineers**

"Industrial engineers devise efficient systems that integrate workers, machines, 
materials, information, and energy to make a product or provide a service."

**Operations Research Analyst**

"Operations research analysts use advanced mathematical and analytical methods 
to help solve complex issues."

Industrial engineering specializes in manufacturing and production in particular
for process improvement [@maynard_zandin_2001]. Methodology includes lean 
manufacturing, six sigma, and just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing. The latter may
eventually be phased out due to COVID causing supply shocks especially in ports.
Operations research focuses on **how to optimize** resources at hand to achieve 
an organizational goal. While operations research analysts are involved in some 
of those processes, they are not directly involved despite helping in that 
decision-making process.
