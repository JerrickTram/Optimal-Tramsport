## Origins

Reliability. That's a word we take for granted these days as we rely more on
tools and infrastructure. Century-old infrastructure projects including the 
pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and Roman coliseums were hallmarks for 
engineering accomplishments. While these feats are significant, **they aren't
immune to the forces of mother nature and father time.** Thus, the need for 
maintenance and upkeep still exists [@nachlas_2017]. Nearly everyone at some 
point in their lives, will experience some sort of failure both internally and 
externally. That's why those experiences are used to improve among ourselves to 
create stronger products, make better decisions, and obtain longer product life 
cycles [@maynard_zandin_2001]. That is what ties industrial engineering, 
operations research, and reliability engineering together.
