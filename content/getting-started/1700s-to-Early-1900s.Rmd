## Origins

Reliability. That's a word we take for granted these days as we rely more on
tools and infrastructure. Century-old infrastructure projects including the 
pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and Roman coliseums were hallmarks for 
engineering accomplishments. While these feats are significant, **they aren't
immune to the forces of mother nature and father time.** Thus, the need for 
maintenance and upkeep still exists [@nachlas_2017]. Nearly everyone at some 
point in their lives, will experience some sort of failure both internally and 
externally. That's why those experiences are used to improve among ourselves to 
create stronger products, make better decisions, and obtain longer product life 
cycles [@maynard_zandin_2001]. That is what ties industrial engineering, 
operations research, and reliability engineering together.

## Industrial Revolution and Onwards

While there isn't an exact date as of when industrial engineering started,
most historians look at the Industrial Revolution due to how
manufacturing practices changed and the technological innovations that 
developed during that timeline. Notable inventions include:

* Flying shuttle (Kay 1733)
* Spinning jenny (Hargreaves 1765)
* Steam engine (Watt 1765)
* Water frame (Arkwright 1769)

With the benefit of hindsight, one could guess which one of these inventions
paved the way for power generation. The steam engine allowed manufacturers to
look at other sources of power instead of relying solely on hydroelectric w
power. As a result, production costs fell, prices fell, and areas that normally
wouldn't have access to hydroelectric energy now have an accessible power 
source through steam. These innovations gave birth to the idea of a production
system due to the increased accessibility.

## Interchangeability and Scientific Management

Before people could buy individual parts for machinery, everything was put
together under one person. Thanks to the efforts of Eli Whitney and Simeon 
North, individual parts could be mass-produced to specifications for any 
finished product [@maynard_zandin_2001]. If interchangeability didn't exist, 
you'd have to go to same craftsman for fixes who may or may not be readily 
available. Frederick W. Taylor on the other hand, wanted to find out "the best 
way to do a job" [@gass_assad_2005]. Under his system, he focused on removing 
wasteful movements of each component within the production process. As a result, 
work efficiency improved tremendously, time spent on tasks were reduced, and 
work measurement standards were developed. In a way, Taylor accomplished the 
same goal with work as Whitney did with parts.

## Project Planning

For those who have worked on any project(s) in any environment, you probably
have seen bar charts that displays the project schedule. Gannt charts, invented
by Henry L. Gantt, proposed them to be used to represent the precedence
relationship between tasks, completion schedules, and tracking performance. 
Its commonly used with in the construction industry with the numerous steps
necessary before moving on to the next phases of construction (i.e. need walls
and a floor before you can build a roof).
